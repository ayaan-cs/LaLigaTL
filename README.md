# LaLiga TL

This project is a data analysis and visualization tool, currently in its skeleton phase. It's built with Python and utilizes Streamlit to provide an interactive web interface. The core functionality is to process and analyze data from various sources, with an initial focus on sports analytics.

## Project Vision

The vision for this project is to evolve into a powerful, live data-tracking and prediction platform. The current application is a foundation that will be expanded with the following features:

* **Live Data Integration:** The plan is to refine the data by integrating a dedicated API to track live data as a season progresses.
* **AI-Powered Insights:** A key future feature will be an AI-based prediction model. This model will provide insights for various applications, such as fantasy football advice and awards like the Balon d'Or prediction.
* **Modern Frontend:** The project is a versatile skeleton, with the potential to be refactored with a modern frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue to provide a more dynamic user experience.

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up and running the application.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ayaan-cs/LaLigaTL.git
    ```

2.  **Install the dependencies:**
    This project uses a Streamlit frontend and requires the packages in a `requirements.txt` file (you will need to create this file yourself with the necessary libraries).

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Streamlit application:**
    From your project's root directory, run the following command in your terminal. This will launch the web application on your local server.

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the app:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided in the terminal output (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
